# Image Representation by Compositing Gaussian Ellipses
*Chang-Chieh Cheng, ITSC, NYCU, Taiwan*

I proposed a method of stroke-based rendering for image representation.
It involves compositing a set of ellipses by combining various locations, sizes, rotation angles, colors, and opacities.

vgi/imaging.py includes all implementation code of the proposed method, where decomposite() is the primary function.
